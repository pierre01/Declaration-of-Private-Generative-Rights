# Declaration of Private Generative Rights

A charter for freedom of thought, private creation, and ethical generative systems.

---

## What this is

The **Declaration of Private Generative Rights** defines ethical boundaries for generative AI in domains where law has not yet caught up.

It affirms a simple but critical distinction:

**Private creation is not public publication.  
Imagination is not action.  
Responsibility begins at publication, not at thought.**

As generative systems enter the most intimate spaces of human creativity, reflection, and expression, this declaration establishes principles to protect dignity, trust, and ethical coherence — without weakening accountability for real harm.

## Core principles (summary)

The declaration asserts that:

- Freedom of thought must remain inviolable in private generative use  
- Private creation must not be subjected to pre-emptive censorship  
- Accountability belongs at publication, not at imagination  
- Users must not be misrepresented by automated classifiers  
- Transparency and consent are required when moderation occurs  
- Retention of private or blocked generations without consent is unethical  

These principles do **not** oppose safety, law, or responsibility.  
They insist on proportionality, clarity, and ethical restraint.

## Adoption and alignment

Adoption is a public ethical alignment, not a legal contract.  
Partial adoption and explicit divergence are both valid and encouraged when stated transparently.

No adopter is expected to be perfect.  
Good faith, visibility, and ethical intent are sufficient.
