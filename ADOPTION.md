# Adoption and Alignment

This document explains what it means to adopt, endorse, or align with the
**Declaration of Private Generative Rights**.

Adoption is voluntary, transparent, and ethical.
It is not a legal contract, certification, or enforcement mechanism.

---

## 1. What adoption means

To adopt the Declaration of Private Generative Rights is to make a **public ethical alignment**.

By adopting, an individual or organization affirms that they:

- Recognize a clear distinction between **private creation** and **public publication**
- Reject pre-emptive censorship of lawful private generative activity
- Support accountability at publication rather than imagination
- Acknowledge the ethical risks of surveilling private generative spaces
- Commit to transparency, consent, and proportional moderation

Adoption expresses intent, not perfection.
Good faith matters more than completeness.

---

## 2. Who may adopt

The declaration may be adopted or aligned with by:

- Individuals (creators, researchers, educators, users)
- Organizations (companies, foundations, labs, platforms)
- Academic or policy bodies (research institutes, ethics boards, regulators)

There is no minimum size, jurisdiction, or technical requirement.

---

## 3. Levels of adoption

Adoption is intentionally **non-binary**.

### 3.1 Individual endorsement

An individual endorsement affirms the principles as a matter of conscience
and ethical belief.

It carries no institutional or representative authority unless explicitly stated.

---

### 3.2 Organizational adoption

Organizations may adopt the declaration in one of three ways:

- **Full adoption**  
  Public alignment with all articles of the declaration.

- **Partial adoption**  
  Alignment with specific articles, with any exclusions stated transparently.

- **Adoption as a guiding standard**  
  Recognition of the declaration as an internal reference or framework under review.

Partial adoption is valid.
Explicit divergence is ethical.
Silence is not.

---

### 3.3 Policy and research alignment

Academic, regulatory, or policy bodies may recognize the declaration as:

- A reference framework
- A comparative ethics baseline
- A discussion standard

Such alignment does not imply endorsement of all articles,
nor does it bind future policy positions.

---

## 4. Public registry

Adoptions may be recorded in a **public Adoption & Alignment Registry**.

Registry entries typically include:

- Name or organization
- Adoption level
- Date of adoption
- Optional public note
- Declaration version at time of adoption

Registry inclusion is optional but encouraged.
Visibility strengthens ethical memory.

---

## 5. Partial adoption and divergence

Adopters are encouraged to state divergence clearly and respectfully.

Examples:

- “Articles IV and VII are under internal legal review.”
- “We align with the declaration as a guiding standard, not as policy.”

Divergence does not weaken the declaration.
It strengthens its honesty.

---

## 6. Updating or withdrawing adoption

Adopters may:

- Update their adoption status
- Clarify scope or intent
- Withdraw adoption entirely

Such changes should be dated and publicly visible when possible.

No adopter is obligated to maintain alignment indefinitely.

---

## 7. What adoption does *not* do

Adoption does not:

- Grant certification or approval
- Confer legal immunity or compliance
- Imply regulatory authority
- Transfer stewardship or ownership
- Prevent criticism or debate

The declaration exists to guide conscience, not to command behavior.

---

## 8. Ethical posture

Adoption is not a claim of moral superiority.

It is a statement of values made visible so that:
- Drift can be seen
- Trust can form
- Dialogue can remain grounded

Ethics gains legitimacy through openness, not enforcement.

---

## 9. Final note

The Declaration of Private Generative Rights is a living ethical standard.
Its strength lies not in unanimity, but in clarity.

To adopt it is not to agree with everyone:
it is to agree that imagination deserves dignity,
and that responsibility begins where expression meets the world.
