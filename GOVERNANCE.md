# Governance and Stewardship

This document defines how the **Declaration of Private Generative Rights** is stewarded, revised, and preserved over time.

The purpose of governance is not control, enforcement, or authority.
It is continuity, integrity, and ethical clarity.

---

## 1. Stewardship, not ownership

The Declaration of Private Generative Rights is not owned.

It is stewarded to preserve:
- Textual integrity
- Ethical continuity
- Public trust
- Historical traceability

Stewardship does not grant the power to enforce, certify, or compel adoption.
It grants only the responsibility to protect meaning.

---

## 2. Scope of governance

Governance applies only to:
- The canonical text (`DECLARATION.md`)
- Official versioning
- Public change records
- Adoption language consistency

Governance does **not** apply to:
- How others interpret the declaration
- Whether organizations adopt or reject it
- Legal enforcement or compliance
- Private derivative frameworks (when clearly labeled)

---

## 3. Versioning principles

The declaration uses semantic versioning, interpreted ethically:

- **Patch versions (v1.0.x)**  
  Clarifications, typographical corrections, formatting changes  
  No change in meaning or scope

- **Minor versions (v1.x.0)**  
  Additive clarifications, new articles, or expanded commentary  
  Must not contradict prior principles

- **Major versions (v2.0.0)**  
  Ethical re-foundation  
  Reserved for rare, explicit, and publicly documented shifts

No version may retroactively invalidate prior adoptions.

Adoption is bound to the version in effect at the time of adoption.

---

## 4. Change proposals

Any proposed change to the canonical text must include:

- A clear description of the proposed change
- A rationale explaining *why* the change is necessary
- An explicit statement of whether the change is:
  - Clarifying
  - Additive
  - Foundational

Proposals must be publicly visible before adoption.

---

## 5. Cooling-off period

To prevent reactive or political drift:

- All non-trivial changes require a public cooling-off period
- The minimum cooling-off period is **30 days**
- During this time, feedback may be received and documented

Urgency is not sufficient justification for bypassing this process.

---

## 6. Emergency clarifications

Emergency updates are permitted **only** to correct:
- Factual errors
- Broken references
- Ambiguities that materially misrepresent intent

Emergency updates may not:
- Introduce new principles
- Remove protections
- Narrow ethical scope

All emergency changes must be logged explicitly.

---

## 7. Transparency and changelog

Every modification to the declaration must be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`, including:

- Version number
- Date
- Nature of change
- Summary of impact

No change may be silent.
No change may be backdated.

---

## 8. Divergent versions

Derivative or modified versions of the declaration are permitted.

However:
- They must be clearly labeled as **divergent**
- They may not use the original title without qualification
- They may not imply endorsement or stewardship authority

Divergence is ethical.
Silent mutation is not.

---

## 9. Stewardship continuity

If stewardship must pass to new maintainers:

- The transition must be publicly documented
- No change in ethical scope may occur during transition
- Historical versions must remain permanently accessible

Stewardship exists to preserve trust across time, not to concentrate power.

---

## 10. Final principle

This declaration is governed to resist erosion, not to accelerate change.

Ethics gains authority through consistency, not speed.
Legitimacy arises from restraint, not control.

---

> Governance is not the power to decide what is right.  
> It is the discipline to prevent meaning from being quietly rewritten.
